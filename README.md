ðŸŒ¿Life in Vancouver

Overview

It's been 3 months since I came here, Vancouver. As you know, there is a lot of immigrants and international student like me in this city. That's also mean many people want to know about good foods, good marchandise, good place in here. 
I was one of them. And also I've been studying web development.
Thus, I came up with idea that I created website which can tell people about Vancouver. This is why I created this.
